# To Do List App
### Simple HTML, CSS, & JS application for to do list organization

_This is a browser to do list application that allows the user to add taks to a list and check items off as they have been completed. Items can also be deleted from the list. The data is stored in the user broswer so will remain upon page reloads._

**Still to do:**
- Add the ability to have multiple to do lists (priority, stretch goals, etc.)
- Add the ability to rename lists
- Allow page styling to be customizable
